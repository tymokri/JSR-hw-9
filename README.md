React. Make component Collapse.jsx

Implement <Collapse> component that, when clicked on a link,
displays or hides its content. If the content is hidden, the click expands it.
Conversely, if the content is displayed, the click hides the content.
The content is passed to the component through the text property. The opened property,
which by default is true, is responsible for the initial open state.
